Appium/mobile testing -

android studio
appium server

appium is an open source tool which we used to automate mobile applications

cucumber
maven
poi ooxml
poi
commons io
selenium
appium

how to check if android studio is working properly, adb in cmd

create/attach device with the computer - Android Studio
connecting the script with the device - it is responsible to connect script with device
it will allow you to identify elements using appium inspector
to write the script - IntellijIDE

in pom.xml file - we need to add dependency

poi ooxml
poi
commons io
selenium
appium
cucumber

we need application to test in the device

for android  - .apk file (extension of your android app)
for IOS - .ipa/.app (extension of your ios app)


to install app from cmd
open the device
open the folder in computer where apk is available
write adb install appname.apk and press enter

how to launch the app using automation script
how to identify the locators
how to run the script

recap -

downloaded android studio
downloaded appium server

set the home/environment variables

downloaded tools under android sdk using android studio
created devices/emulators in android studio
we installed apk in the device using cmd/drag n drop
how to check android is installed - adb
how to check if the device is opened - adb devices

created a maven project

made structure of the framework
written login scenario
generated all the step definitions
created runner class

we have to launch the application in mobile using script

your developers will provide you these detail -
app package -
app activity -

desired capabilities - it provides the information about the execution
devicename
platformname
version
which application
which os


keep your device on and running
keep your appium server on and running
you must enter the correct details under desired capabilities


if you are getting UIautomator exited error
then create new device
select API level 29, download it and then create device
restart appium server
restart Intellij
open the newly generated device and install the app
and then run the code

uiautomatorviewer is responsible to locate elements in application
appium inspector is also used to locate elements in application

//*[@attribute='Value of attribute']

//*[@text='Username']
//*[@content-desc='test-Password']
//*[@text='LOGIN']

we have Page object model design pattern
we keep object repository - locators
